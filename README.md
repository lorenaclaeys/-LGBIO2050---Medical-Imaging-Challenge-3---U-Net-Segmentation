Lately, computer-assisted tools have been developed based on image processing to assist in cancer diagnosis. These tools take as an input [histopathological images](https://encyclopedia.pub/entry/8696#:~:text=Histopathology%20images%20can%20be%20acquired,with%20one%20or%20more%20stains.), try to count malignant versus healthy cells and more precisely aim at performing a **robust segmentation of these malignant cells**.

In the dataset you will be working with, medical doctors want you to segment both the cell nuclei as well as their body.

This challenge's goal is twofold: 

1.   Develop a baseline segmentation method based on [U-Net](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.04597.pdf)
2.   Improve the baseline segmentation
